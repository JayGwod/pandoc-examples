# Assignment Two: Hypothesis Testing

## the calculation of the sample mean from the raw observations

$$ \overline{x} = (992+1002+1000+1001+998+999+1000+995+1003+1001+997+997)/12 = 998.75 $$

## the formulation of the hypotheses, H*{0} and H*{1}

$H_{0}: \mu = 1000$ml vs. $H_{1}: \mu \neq 1000$ml.

## calculation of the test statistic value

## calculation of the p-value

## a decision of whether or not to reject H0

## an inferential conclusion about what the test result means

## indication of which type of error might have occurred
