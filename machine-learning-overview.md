# Introduction

This overview provides a high level perspective of machine learning. Firstly,
the concept of machine learning would be discussed and then to consider which
necessary components should be included to build a relatively complete learning
system. "Learning algorithm" plays a central role in the field of machine
learning, therefore in the next part the main ideas would be introduced: the
framework of empirical risk minimization, the principle of maximum likelihood
and the idea of probabilistic models. Besides algorithms, how to apply the
techniques of machine learning is another very important topic. In the last
part, the current best practices would be briefly outlined, including how to
train a model such that the resulting predictor does well on data not yet seen,
how to select a model and how to set up your machine learning workflow.

# Components of a machine learning system

There are three major components of a machine learning system: data, models and
learning. This section covers a few necessary bits and pieces of mathematical and statistical
language that are commonly used to talk about machine learning systems.

## Data as Vectors
