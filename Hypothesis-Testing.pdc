# Assignment Two: Hypothesis Testing

## Calculation of the sample mean from the raw observations

$$ \overline{x} = (992+1002+1000+1001+998+999+1000+995+1003+1001+997+997)/12 = 998.75 $$

## Formulation of the hypotheses, $H_{0}$ and $H_{1}$

$H_{0}: \mu = 1000$ml vs. $H_{1}: \mu \neq 1000$ml.

## Calculation of the test statistic value

We proceed by **standardising** $\overline{X}$ such that:

$$ Z = \frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim N(0,1) $$

acts as our **test statistic**. Note the test statistic includes the effect size,
$\overline{X}-\mu$, as well as sample size, $n$.

Using our sample data, we now obtain the test statistic value (noting the **influence of
both the effect size and the sample size**, and hence ultimately the influence on the
$p$-value):

$$ \frac{1000 - 998.75}{\sqrt{1.5}/\sqrt{12}} \approx 3.5. $$

## Calculation of the $p$-value

The $p$-value is the probability of our test statistic value or a more extreme
value conditional on $H_0$. Noting that $H_1:\mu \neq 1000$, 'more extreme' here
means a $z$-score > 3.5 and < -3.5. Due to the symmetry of the standard normal
distribution about zero, this can be expressed as:

$$ p-value = P(Z \geq \mid 3.5 \mid) = 0.00046. $$

## A decision of whether or not to reject $H_{0}$

Recall the **$p$-value decision rule**, since 0.00046 < 0.05 we reject $H_0$ and
conclude that the result 'statistically significant' at the 5% significance level
(and also, of course, at the 1% significance level).

## An inferential conclusion about what the test result means

Hence there is (strong) evidence that $\mu \neq 1000$. Since $\overline{x} < \mu$
we might go further and suppose that $\mu < 1000$.

## Indication of which type of error might have occurred

As we have rejected $H_0$ this means of two things:

- we have correctly rejected $H_0$
- we have committed a Type I error.

Although the $p$-value is very small, indicating it is *highly unlikely* that is
a Type I error, unfortunately we cannot be certain which outcome has actually occurred!
