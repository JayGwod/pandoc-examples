# Assignment Two: Hypothesis Testing

We consider the **hypothesis test of a population mean** in the context of a 
claim made by a manufacturer.

As an example, the amount of water in mineral water bottles exhibits slight 
variations attributable to the bottle-filling machine at the factory not putting 
in *identical* quantities of water in each bottle. The labels on each bottle may 
state '1000ml' but this equates to a **claim about the average contents** 
of all bottles produced (in the population of bottles).

## Calculation of the sample mean from the raw observations

A random sample of $n=12$ bottles resulted in the measurements (in ml): 
992, 1002, 1000, 1001, 998, 999, 1000, 995, 1003, 1001, 997 and 997.

Calculate the sample mean in our random sample:

$$ \overline{x} = (992+1002+1000+1001+998+999+1000+995+1003+1001+997+997)/12 = 998.75 $$

## Formulation of the hypotheses, $\text{H}_{0}$ and $\text{H}_{1}$

It is assumed that the true variance of water in all bottles is $\sigma^2 = 1.5$, 
and that the amount of water in bottles is normally distributed. Let $X$ denote 
the quantity of water in a bottle such that:

$$ X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) $$

and we wish to test:

$$ \text{H}_{0}: \mu = 1000 \text{ml} \quad \text{vs.} \quad \text{H}_{1}: \mu \neq 1000ml. $$

The question is whether the difference between $\overline{x} = 998.75$ and the 
claim $\mu = 1000$ is:

(a) **due to sampling error** (and hence $\text{H}_0$ is true)?
(b) **statistically significant** (and hence $\text{H}_1$ is true)?

**Determination of the $p$-value** will allow us to choose between explanations (a) and (b).

## Calculation of the test statistic value

We proceed by **standardising** $\overline{X}$ such that:

$$ Z = \frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim N(0,1) $$

acts as our **test statistic**. Note the test statistic includes the effect size,
$\overline{X}-\mu$, as well as sample size, $n$.

Using our sample data, we now obtain the test statistic value (noting the **influence of
both the effect size and the sample size**, and hence ultimately the influence on the
$p$-value):

$$ \frac{998.75 - 1000}{\sqrt{1.5}/\sqrt{12}} \approx -3.5. $$

## Calculation of the $p$-value

The $p$-value is the probability of our test statistic value or a more extreme
value conditional on $\text{H}_0$. Noting that $\text{H}_1:\mu \neq 1000$, 'more extreme' here
means a $z$-score > 3.5 and < -3.5. Due to the symmetry of the standard normal
distribution about zero, this can be expressed as:

$$ p\text{-value} = P(Z \geq \mid 3.5 \mid) = 0.00046. $$

## A decision of whether or not to reject $\text{H}_{0}$

Recall the **$p$-value decision rule**, and since 0.00046 < 0.05 we reject $\text{H}_0$ and
conclude that the result 'statistically significant' at the 5% significance level
(and also, of course, at the 1% significance level).

## An inferential conclusion about what the test result means

Hence there is (strong) evidence that $\mu \neq 1000$. Since $\overline{x} < \mu$
we might go further and suppose that $\mu < 1000$.

## Indication of which type of error might have occurred

As we have rejected $\text{H}_0$ this means of two things:

- we have correctly rejected $\text{H}_0$
- we have committed a Type I error.

Although the $p$-value is very small, indicating it is *highly unlikely* that is
a Type I error, unfortunately we cannot be *certain* which outcome has actually occurred!
