# Probability and Statistics

## 1.1 The Monty Hall problem

The famous 'Monty Hall' problem is a classic example of **decision making under
uncertainty**.

The only certainty is that the prize _must_ be behind one of the _three_ doors.
Upon revealing one of the doors you did not choose, you still face uncertainty -
the only certainty is that the prize _must_ be behind one of the _two_ unopened
doors.

## 1.2 Decision making under uncertainty

Decisions have to be taken in the present, with **uncertain future outcomes**.

There are two important implications for everyone in the **age of technology**:

1. **Collect vast amounts of data** - the era of **'big data'**.
1. **Analyse data** and **make decisions** on the basis of quantitative
   analysis.

A source of competitive advantage: **data-driven decision-making**

**Decision-making is a process when one is faced with a problem or decision
having more than one possible outcome.**

The possible results from the decision are a function of two variables:

1. **internal variables**: we can control.
1. **external variables**: we cannot control.

Uncertain variables --> The uncertain outcome

For all decisions, we need to **determine the influencing factors** which could
either be internal or external, then used to derive **expected results** or
_consequences_.

### _Qualitative_ analysis vs. _Quantitative_ analysis

#### In a _qualitative_ analysis

- the management team 'qualitatively' evaluates how each factor could affect the
  decision.
- this discussion leads to an assessment by the decision-maker.
- the decisions is made followed by implementation, if necessary.

We could make this assessment using the (qualitative) qualifiers of:

- 'optimistic'
- 'conservative'
- 'pessimistic'

However, a qualitative approach inevitably is **susceptible to judgement and
hence biases** on the part of the decision-makers. 'Gut instinct' _can_ lead to
good outcomes, but in the long run is far from optimal.

#### In a _quantitative_ analysis

- the evaluation becomes a process of **using mathematics and statistical
  techniques**.
- find predictive relationships between the factors and the potential outcomes.
- seek to understand the problem.

1. Define mathematically the relationships;
1. Evaluate the significance of the predictive value of the relationships found;
1. Quantitatively express the expected results or consequences of the decision
   we are making.

## 1.3 Uncertainty in the news

_News_ reports new **information about events** taking place in the world.

**Decisions are made in the present, with uncertain future outcomes.** Hence
many media reports will comment on the **uncertainties** being faced.

**'Black swan'** - **low-probability, high-impact events**

Increasingly, quantitative hedge funds and asset managers will **trade
algorithmically**, with computers designed to scan the internet for news stories
and interpret whether news reports contain any **useful information** which
would allow a **revision of probabilistic beliefs**.

## 1.4 Simplicity vs. Complexity - the need for models

**A model is a deliberate simplification of reality.** A good model retains the
most important features of reality and ignores less important details. Broadly
speaking, we would be happy if the benefit exceed the cost, i.e. if the
simplicity made it easier for us to understand and analyse the real world while
incurring only a minimal departure from reality.

Caution: a model is a departure from reality, blind belief in a model might be
misleading.

Our key takeaway is that models inevitably involve trade-offs. As we further
simplify reality(a benefit), we further depart from reality(a cost). In order to
determine whether or not a model is 'good', we must decide whether the benefit
justifies the cost. **Resolving this benefit-cost trade-off is subjective** -
further adding to life's complexities.

## 1.5 Beware when model assumptions go wrong

To assist with the process of model building, we often make **assumptions** -
usually _simplifying_ assumptions.

Beware assumptions - if you make a wrong or invalid assumption, then decisions
you make in good faith may lead to outcomes far from what you expected.
